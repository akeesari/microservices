# Introduction

Welcome to my Free e-Book: `Building Microservices with Containers: A Practical Guide`. In today's rapidly growing technological landscape, the demand for scalable, flexible, and resilient software solutions is necessary. In response to this demand, the architecture of choice for many modern applications is microservices. Microservices enables the development of complex systems as a set of small, independently deployable services.

This book is your detailed guide to understanding and implementing microservices architecture using containerization technology, specifically Docker. Whether you're a regular application developer looking to adopt microservices or a new to the technology, this book will provide you with the knowledge and hands-on experience necessary to succeed in building scalable and maintainable applications.
