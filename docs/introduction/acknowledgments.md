# **Acknowledgments**

Writing a book is a collaborative effort, and I could not have done it without the help and support of many people.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my family for their patience, understanding, and encouragement throughout this project, they scarified lot of (long) weekends. Their love and support kept me going during the long hours of writing and editing.

<!-- I would like to thank my editor and the entire team at [publisher name] for their guidance and support throughout the entire publishing process. Their expertise and professionalism made this book possible. -->

During this book writing I had to refer lot of online materials, I would also like to thank the many individuals and organizations who have contributed to the development of Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Helm, Terraform, and containerization technologies. Without their hard work and dedication, this book would not be possible.

Finally, I would like to thank the readers of this book for their interest and support. I hope that this book will be a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn how to build and deploy microservices applications on a Kubernetes using ArgoCD and Helm.

Thank you all for your contributions and support.

Warm regards,

Anji Keesari
